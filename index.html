    	Dogecoin was created by programmer Billy Markus of Portland, Oregon, who hoped to make a fun cryptocurrency that could reach a broader demographic than Bitcoin. In addition, he wanted to distance it from the controversial history behind Bitcoin, mainly its association with the Silk Road online drug marketplace.[14]

At the same time, Jackson Palmer, a member of Adobe Systems' marketing department in Sydney, Australia, was encouraged by a student at Front Range Community College on Twitter to make the idea a reality.[15]
After receiving several mentions on Twitter, Palmer purchased the domain dogecoin.com and added a splash screen featuring the coin's logo and scattered comic sans text. Markus saw the site linked in an IRC chat room, and started efforts to create the currency after reaching out to Palmer. Markus based Dogecoin on the existing cryptocurrency Luckycoin,[16] from which it derives its randomized reward received for mining a block. In turn, Luckycoin is based on Litecoin,[3] which also uses scrypt technology in its proof-of-work algorithm. The use of scrypt means that miners cannot use SHA-256 Bitcoin mining equipment. Dogecoin was officially launched several days later on December 11.[17][18] The Dogecoin network was originally intended to produce 100 billion Dogecoins.[19][20][21]

On December 19, 2013, Dogecoin jumped over 300 percent in value in 72 hours, rising from USD$0.00026 to $0.0095,[22] with a volume of hundreds of Bitcoins per day[23]. This growth occurred during a time when Bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies were reeling from China's decision to forbid Chinese banks from investing Chinese Yuan into the Bitcoin economy.[3] Three days later, Dogecoin experienced its first major crash by dropping by 80% due to large mining pools seizing opportunity in exploiting the very little computing power required at the time to mine the coin.[24]

On December 24, 2013, The Reserve Bank of India cautioned users of Dogecoin and other virtual currencies on the risks associated with them.[25] On December 25, 2013, the first major theft attempt of Dogecoin occurred when millions of coins were stolen during a hacking attempt on the online wallet platform Dogewallet.[26] The hacker gained access to the platform's filesystem and modified its send/receive page to send any and all coins to a static address.[27][28] This incident spiked Tweets about Dogecoin making it the most mentioned altcoin on Twitter.[29] To help those who lost funds on Dogewallet after its breach, the Dogecoin community started an initiative named "SaveDogemas" to help donate coins to those who lost them. Approximately one month later, enough money was donated to cover all of the coins that were lost.[30] By January 2014, the trading volume of Dogecoin surpassed that of Bitcoin and all other crypto-currencies combined.[31]

On January 19, 2014, a fundraiser was established by the Dogecoin community to raise $50,000 for the Jamaican Bobsled Team, which had qualified for, but could not afford to go to, the Sochi Winter Olympics. By the second day, $30,000 worth of Dogecoin was donated,[32] and the Dogecoin to Bitcoin exchange rate rose by 50%.[33][34][35][36][37] The Dogecoin community also raised funds for a second Sochi athlete Shiva Keshavan.[38] As of 13 February 2014, Dogecoin has a market capitalization of USD$81 million.[39]
